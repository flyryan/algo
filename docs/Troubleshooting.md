### Error: "You have not agreed to the Xcode license agreements"

On macOS, did you try to install the dependencies with pip and encounter the following error?

```
Downloading cffi-1.9.1.tar.gz (407kB): 407kB downloaded
  Running setup.py (path:/private/tmp/pip_build_root/cffi/setup.py) egg_info for package cffi

You have not agreed to the Xcode license agreements, please run 'xcodebuild -license' (for user-level acceptance) or 'sudo xcodebuild -license' (for system-wide acceptance) from within a Terminal window to review and agree to the Xcode license agreements.

    No working compiler found, or bogus compiler options
    passed to the compiler from Python's distutils module.
    See the error messages above.

The Xcode compiler is installed but requires you to accept its license agreement prior to using it. Run `xcodebuild -license` to agree and then retry installing the dependencies.

You are running an old version of `pip` that cannot build the `pycrypto` dependency. Upgrade to a new version of `pip` by running `sudo pip install -U pip`.
